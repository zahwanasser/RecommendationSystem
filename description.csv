Jeannette Walls Grew Up With Parents Whose Ideals And Stubborn Nonconformity Were Both Their Curse And Their Salvation. Rex And Rose Mary Walls Had Four Children. In The Beginning, They Lived Like Nomads, Moving Among Southwest Desert Towns, Camping In The Mountains. Rex Was A Charismatic, Brilliant Man Who, When Sober, Captured His Children'S Imagination, Teaching Them Physics, Geology, And Above All, How To Embrace Life Fearlessly. Rose Mary, Who Painted And Wrote And Couldn'T Stand The Responsibility Of Providing For Her Family, Called Herself An ""Excitement Addict."" Cooking A Meal That Would Be Consumed In Fifteen Minutes Had No Appeal When She Could Make A Painting That Might Last Forever. 
Later, When The Money Ran Out, Or The Romance Of The Wandering Life Faded, The Walls Retreated To The Dismal West Virginia Mining Town -- And The Family -- Rex Walls Had Done Everything He Could To Escape. He Drank. He Stole The Grocery Money And Disappeared For Days. As The Dysfunction Of The Family Escalated, Jeannette And Her Brother And Sisters Had To Fend For Themselves, Supporting One Another As They Weathered Their Parents' Betrayals And, Finally, Found The Resources And Will To Leave Home. 
What Is So Astonishing About Jeannette Walls Is Not Just That She Had The Guts And Tenacity And Intelligence To Get Out, But That She Describes Her Parents With Such Deep Affection And Generosity. Hers Is A Story Of Triumph Against All Odds, But Also A Tender, Moving Tale Of Unconditional Love In A Family That Despite Its Profound Flaws Gave Her The Fiery Determination To Carve Out A Successful Life On Her Own Terms. 
For Two Decades, Jeannette Walls Hid Her Roots. Now She Tells Her Own Story. "

4264,"Angela'S Ashes (Frank Mccourt, #1) ","Imbued On Every Page With Frank Mccourt'S Astounding Humor And Compassion. This Is A Glorious Book That Bears All The Marks Of A Classic.

""When I Look Back On My Childhood I Wonder How I Managed To Survive At All. It Was, Of Course, A Miserable Childhood: The Happy Childhood Is Hardly Worth Your While. Worse Than The Ordinary Miserable Childhood Is The Miserable Irish Childhood, And Worse Yet Is The Miserable Irish Catholic Childhood."" 

So Begins The Pulitzer Prize Winning Memoir Of Frank Mccourt, Born In Depression-Era Brooklyn To Recent Irish Immigrants And Raised In The Slums Of Limerick, Ireland. Frank'S Mother, Angela, Has No Money To Feed The Children Since Frank'S Father, Malachy, Rarely Works, And When He Does He Drinks His Wages. Yet Malachy-- Exasperating, Irresponsible And Beguiling-- Does Nurture In Frank An Appetite For The One Thing He Can Provide: A Story. Frank Lives For His Father'S Tales Of Cuchulain, Who Saved Ireland, And Of The Angel On The Seventh Step, Who Brings His Mother Babies. 

Perhaps It Is Story That Accounts For Frank'S Survival. Wearing Rags For Diapers, Begging A Pig'S Head For Christmas Dinner And Gathering Coal From The Roadside To Light A Fire, Frank Endures Poverty, Near-Starvation And The Casual Cruelty Of Relatives And Neighbors--Yet Lives To Tell His Tale With Eloquence, Exuberance And Remarkable Forgiveness.

“Why Did You Leave Sierra Leone?” “Because There Is A War.” “You Mean, You Saw People Running Around With Guns And Shooting Each Other?” “Yes, All The Time.” “Cool.” I Smile A Little. “You Should Tell Us About It Sometime.” “Yes, Sometime.”

A Chronicle Of Ideas And Of Personal Commitments And Betrayals, Safranski'S Biography Combines Clear Accounts Of The Philosophy That Won Heidegger Eternal Renown With The Fascinating Details Of The Loves And Lapses That Tripped Up This Powerful Intellectual.

The Best Intellectual Biography Of Heidegger Ever Written And A Best-Seller In Germany, Martin Heidegger: Between Good And Evil Does Not Shy Away From Full Coverage Of Heidegger'S Shameful Transformation Into A Propagandist For The National Socialist Regime; Nor Does It Allow This Aspect Of His Career To Obscure His Accomplishments.
